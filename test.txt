When you open your eyes, you see a massive dragon standing over you, its scales shining in the moonlight.
 The dragon looks at you with curiosity, as if it is unsure what to make of you.


What do you do next? Do you try to make peace with the dragon, or do you attack it in a last ditch effort to save yourself? The choice is yours.


You realize that you have no chance of defeating the dragon in your current state, so you decide to try and make peace with it instead.
 You slowly and carefully get to your feet, trying not to make any sudden movements that might be interpreted as hostile.

 You speak softly, trying to calm the beast and let it know that you mean it no harm.


To your surprise, the dragon responds to your words.
 It lowers its head and sniffs at your outstretched hands, as if trying to determine whether you are telling the truth.


After a moment, the dragon seems to accept that you are not a threat.
